Stay on the page, so you dont have to redirect the users to everywhere to their form slug.

Card have a image to make it more prettier, also the card will indicate colors if its has been already done or if its'active. If its not active the card will be shown but the users can't interact with it, and provides feedback to the user when the form will be avaible to fill in.

Also not forget to mention that my second idea has slugs for each of the card, so if the user presses on a card he/she will be redirected to that specifc page where they can fill in the form.

Also I have made a begin state here where a student can put in their studentnumber that is being saved for further uses to process their data.
